# Programming languages

## JS
The purpose of this module is to:

- Know the abstraction level of different programming languages
- Learn the main properties that programming languages can have
- Lose the fear to try new programming languages
- Understand the importance of being technology-agnostic

## Levels of abstraction
- Programming languages are written with other programming languages, it is basically parsing instructions through other programming language and then returning the desired outcome
- Computers execute binary code
- The lowest-level programming language is Assembly
- Every other programming language is built on top of Assembly, in an ascending pyramid of abstraction
- The more you go up in these layers of abstraction, the more your code becomes concise and expressive, but you give up control over lower-level details
- higher dev speed but give up control

## Programming language properties
- Compiled / Interpreted - once compiled it becomes binary. Interpreted also called scripting. Compiled is  very efficient but changing something requires recompiling.
- Static / Dynamic - static also called stictly typed, needs to define datatypes and are less prone to bugs. Dynamic or also loosely typed.
- Object oriented - if comes with classes, objects, OOP principles
- Memory management - also known as garbage collection
- Reflective - examine the structure of the program and its data. The language of the program, is the programming language, and the language of the examination is meta programming language. If they are the same, then the language is reflective. JS is reflective.
- Functional - first class functions, which means function can take function as argument, higher order functions which return a function, or anonymous functions = lambda. Further distinguishes pure functional (only pure functions) and impure functional.
- Imperative / declarative - imperative - how to do it step by step, declarative - what I want in the end. A for loop would be imperative, .map is declarative - its like using API

## Separation of concerns - worry only about one thing

## Being language-agnostic
### Ruby
- Interpreted, dynamic, OOP, memory managed, reflective and functional
- written in C
- closes syntax to human language
- designed for programmer productivity
- package manager gems
- ruby on rails - really popular for BE web development

### Python (1991)
- written in C
- Interpreted, dynamic, OOP, memory managed, reflective and functional
- Highly readabale
- package manager pip
- very good background on math processing

### C
- wanted to have a better language to write Unix
- Compiled, static, manual memory management, imperative
- mother of all, still very popular
- most popular to programming IoT devices
- one of the fastest programming languages

### So what is best?
- No programming language is best in “absolute” terms
- You need to be able to evaluate what fits your requirements
  - how hard will it be to recruit other
  - documentation
  - is there support?
- Community and documentation are important
- Try new technologies, but shoot for stability in production
