## Present yourself as a professional developer
- In a job interview people want to understand your experience, your passion, and your determination.
- These concepts are not mentally associated with a short time interval.
- Think of any programming or software-related activities you’ve had in the past few years.
 Create a coherent story that connects these dots in an upward trajectory to present yourself as a Software Engineer.

## Avoid pitfalls that would harm your job search
- Every programmer, independently of their technical level, is affected by the impostor syndrome.
- In reality, Software Engineering has lots of fields, and nobody can be an absolute expert. Good professionals just become more knowledgeable in certain areas.
- The only thing that defines your preparation is what you can do. Think about the apps you have built lately. This is what makes you a programmer.
- Be aware of the difference between being humble and dragging yourself down.
- Going through a job search is substantially unpleasant, because you feel judged and there are uncertainties about the outcome of each step.
- Recognize these dynamics and avoid reactions like procrastinating, postponing the job search, applying to too few companies, or accepting the first offer without investigating other available opportunities.

## Set up the core assets you need
- If you want to get access to interesting opportunities you need to show some experience in the field.
- The projects that you’ve developed during the course are a great starting point. Review the repos and make sure they’re in a presentable state.
- For team projects divide the required work equally among members, and then just sync the repos.
- Your LinkedIn profile and CV should focus on the technologies and engineering roles you have enjoyed more during this course.
- Don’t downgrade yourself with words like “junior”, and don’t add sentences like “looking for a job”.
- Your profile should be short, to the point, and contain just the relevant information.
