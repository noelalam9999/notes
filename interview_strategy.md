# Interview strategy
## Approach
- The best possible outcome a company can have from an interview is to hire the candidate.
- Approach interviews thinking that you and the company are working towards the same goal.
- Go with a positive attitude, and make the interview a conversation.
- If you feel nervous, before starting, try for a couple of minutes to breathe, inhaling from your nose for 5-6 seconds, and exhaling from your mouth for 10-12 seconds.
- Each company has a different selection process, ask them what steps are involved, and try to get as much information as you can in advance.
- Don’t ever take any interview outcome personally. Think of it as a game. You need to see what works and what doesn’t and keep improving.

## Relevant questions
- Prepare a list of questions about things that are relevant for you, and you can ask to each company you talk with.
- Here are some examples:
  - What are my responsibilities going to be?
  - What is your approach to remote work?
  - Who am I going to be working with?
  - How big is the team?
  - What technologies do you use? Do you do testing?
  - Do you use scrum or agile methodologies?
  - What is the growth plan and what are your targets for this year?
  - How flexible is your schedule?
  - Do you have a budget for equipment or to keep studying?
- It’s up to you to find the right moment to ask them, and you can also split them among different interviews.

## The personal interview
- Rehearse your background story until it’s smooth, it fits in a couple of minutes, it’s coherent, interesting, and drives the attention of the interviewer to the areas that you are happy to discuss further.
- Before going to the interview spend a few minutes investigating the company, and find out why it would be interesting for you to work there. Make sure you have genuine reasons and can express them if asked.
- Watch your body language and your voice. Stand straight but not too rigid, look people in the eyes, don’t cross your arms or your legs, speak clearly, and smile.
- Practice a few times at home by video recording yourself and then looking at it.
- If they ask you about your salary expectations, kindly ask them to make an offer you’ll consider it. Resist the pressure and avoid providing a specific number.

## The tech interview
- Tech interviews can involve short problems to solve, small apps to build, and theory questions.
- Interviews can be live (in-person or remotely), or you could receive some requirements to fulfill within a few days.
- The worst thing you can do in an interview is to throw nonsense answers because you’re nervous and want to show that you have things to say.
- The second worst thing you can do is to stay completely silent.
- Always make sure that you’ve understood correctly what they’re asking you, and explain your thought process as you solve the problem.
- Break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts, and implement the simplest possible solution first.
- Once you have a working implementation, start talking about its limitations, ways to improve it, and edge cases that could be handled better.
